Hello I am 0x3a6294e or 0x3a in short. I am a software Engineer, turned revese engineer. I enjoy puzzles, and what better puzzles to slove then ones with viruses. 

I enjoy asking deep and thoughtful questions.

I am going to take us on an adventure throw the inter workings of the CPU to the tools used for analyst. I hope you enjoy the ride!
